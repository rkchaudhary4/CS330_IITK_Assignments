To check whether children have exited, wait for 3 lines.
This confirms that players in level 1 must have exited by now.
If number of players < 7, OK
else test case failed.

Send ctrl+Z signal to process. Cross verify that process doesn't terminate on receving it.


Whether they are using wait() for cleanup?
Whether they are terminating players after every level?
Whether they are terminating as well as cleaning zombie players after every level?


OR 

can we predecide when a child should exit and we see whether it is true or not.
Eg: We make a player loose in first round.
Then we check when this player exits.
Eg: We make p7 loose in level1 and make p1 winner. Later we can check which exits first p1 or p7. If properly handled, then always p7 exits.
If not properly handled, then, when pipe ends are severed, depending on which child is scheduled first, order of exit may vary. 


Maybe check how much communication happens after p7 looses. If "write(GO)" happens, this means player has exited correctly.
